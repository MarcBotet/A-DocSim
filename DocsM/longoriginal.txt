example 310 Figure 36 shows part of a signature matrix of 12 rows divided
into four bands of three rows each the second and fourth of the explicitly
shown columns each have the column vector in the first band so they
will definitely hash to the same bucket in the hashing for the first band thus
regardless of what those columns look like in the other three bands, this pair
of columns will be a candidate pair it is possible that other columns such as
the first two shown explicitly will also hash to the same bucket according to
the hashing of the first band however since their column vectors are different
and and there are many buckets for each hashing we expect the
chances of an accidental collision to be very small we shall normally assume
that two vectors hash to the same bucket if and only if they are identical
two columns that do not agree in band 1 have three other chances to become
a candidate pair they might be identical in any one of these other bands
notice that several of the distance measures introduced in this section are
not euclidean spaces a property of euclidean spaces that we shall find
important when we take up clustering in chapter 7 is that the average
of points in a euclidean space always exists and is a point in the space
however consider the space of sets for which we defined the Jaccard distance
the notion of the average of two sets makes no sense likewise
the space of strings where we can use the edit distance does not let us
take the average of strings
vector spaces for which we suggested the cosine distance may or may
not be euclidean if the components of the vectors can be any real numbers
then the space is euclidean however if we restrict components to
be integers then the space is not euclidean notice that for instance we
cannot find an average of the vectors and in the space of vectors
with two integer components although if we treated them as members of
the two dimensional euclidean space then we could say that their average
